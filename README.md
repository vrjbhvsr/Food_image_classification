## Food Image classification
The Food Image Classification project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately classifying images of food into 20 distinct categories. With the widespread availability of food images on social media platforms, food delivery apps, and recipe websites, automatic classification of food images can be immensely beneficial for various applications such as dietary tracking, menu recommendation systems, and food recognition for visually impaired individuals.
